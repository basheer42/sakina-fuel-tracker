## üîß Configuration

### User Groups Setup
Create user groups with appropriate permissions:

1. **Admin Group**: Full access to all features
2. **Viewer Group**: Read-only access to data

```bash
python manage.py shell
```
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, Permission
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from shipments.models import Shipment, Trip

# Create Admin group with all permissions
admin_group = Group.objects.create(name='Admin')
permissions = Permission.objects.filter(content_type__app_label='shipments')
admin_group.permissions.set(permissions)

# Create Viewer group with view-only permissions
viewer_group = Group.objects.create(name='Viewer')
view_permissions = permissions.filter(codename__startswith='view_')
viewer_group.permissions.set(view_permissions)
```

### Email Processing Setup
For automated KPC integration:

1. Enable email processing in `.env`:
```env
EMAIL_PROCESSING_ENABLED=True
EMAIL_STATUS_UPDATE_SENDER_FILTER=notifications@kpc.co.ke
EMAIL_BOL_SENDER_FILTER=bol@kpc.co.ke
```

2. Set up scheduled tasks:
```bash
# Add to crontab for regular processing
*/15 * * * * cd /path/to/project && python manage.py process_status_emails
*/30 * * * * cd /path/to/project && python manage.py process_bol_emails
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Adding Shipments
1. Navigate to **Shipments** ‚Üí **Add New Shipment**
2. Fill in vessel ID, supplier, product, destination, and quantities
3. System automatically calculates total cost and sets quantity remaining

### Recording Loadings
1. **Method 1**: Upload KPC Loading Authority PDF
   - Go to **Upload Loading Authority**
   - System automatically extracts order details and creates trip
   
2. **Method 2**: Manual Entry
   - Navigate to **Loadings** ‚Üí **Add New Loading**
   - Enter KPC order number, vehicle, customer details
   - Add compartment quantities (exactly 3 required)

### Stock Management
- Stock is automatically depleted when trips reach `KPC_APPROVED` status
- L20 actuals from BoL PDFs trigger re-calculation when status becomes `LOADED`
- FIFO system ensures oldest stock is used first
- Real-time stock levels shown on dashboard

### Email Integration
The system processes two types of emails:
- **Status Updates**: Auto-update trip status from KPC notifications
- **BoL PDFs**: Extract actual loading quantities and reconcile stock

## üõ†Ô∏è Management Commands

### Email Processing
```bash
# Process KPC status update emails
python manage.py process_status_emails

# Process BoL PDF emails
python manage.py process_bol_emails
```

### Batch Operations
```bash
# Run both email processors
./run_email_processors.bat  # Windows
```

## üìä Dashboard Features

### Activity Charts
- 30-day loading trends by product
- Delivery statistics and turnover rates

### Smart Notifications
- **Aging Stock**: Items older than 25 days

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### 1. Environment Setup
```env
DEBUG=False
DATABASE_ENGINE=postgresql
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True

pip install gunicorn
gunicorn fuel_project.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## ü§ù API Integration

### KPC Integration Points
- **IMAP Email Processing**: Automated status updates
- **PDF Document Parsing**: Loading authority and BoL processing
- **Order Number Matching**: Links email updates to existing trips

### Extensibility
The system is designed for easy integration with:
- ERP systems via Django REST framework (future enhancement)
- Mobile applications for field operations
- Third-party logistics platforms

## üìù Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PDF Parsing Failures**
```bash
# Check PDF content manually
python manage.py shell
from shipments.views import parse_loading_authority_pdf
# Debug parsing with sample files
```

**Email Processing Issues**
```bash
# Test email connection
python manage.py shell
import imaplib
mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com', 993)
mail.login('user', 'password')
```

**Stock Inconsistencies**
```bash
# Recalculate stock levels
python manage.py shell
from shipments.models import Shipment
for shipment in Shipment.objects.all():
    shipment.save()  # Triggers recalculation
```

### Performance Optimization
- Database indexes are pre-configured for common queries
- Caching enabled for dashboard calculations
- Pagination implemented for large datasets
